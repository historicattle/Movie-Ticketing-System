# Super Simple Documentation for Movie-Ticketing-System

**Imagine the project is a magic movie-theater playground. This document will tell you, like the world's friendliest guide, how every ride works, what's already there, and what fun stuff is left to build. We'll explain every piece so even if you've never built with code-blocks before, you'll understand!**

## What is this project for?
This is a **Movie Ticket Booking System.** It's a website+server that lets people:
- Sign up and log in (make an account or enter their old one)
- See what movies are showing, pick a favorite one
- Choose a time to watch the movie (showtime)
- Pick how many seats they want, and book them!

Think of it as an online version of buying tickets at a real movie theater—but you do it on your phone or computer.

## How does the project work?
The project is split like a big LEGO set into **two main boxes:**
1. **Backend (the hidden brain):**
   - Remembers who you are
   - Stores all movies, users, bookings, and shows
   - Makes sure seats don't get double-booked (so two people can't sit in the same seat!)
   - Runs on a special language called JavaScript, and talks to a database like a memory box

2. **Frontend (what you see and click):**
   - Shows web pages—like "sign up," "pick a movie," "see your bookings"
   - Includes buttons, forms, pictures, all the fun stuff

## What has already been built?
### In the Backend (the "brain"):
- **User sign-up/login:** Lets new users join or old users log in, keeps passwords safe by hiding them
- **Movies:** Stores info about each movie: name, details, time, how many seats!
- **Showtimes:** For each movie, stores *when* and *where* it's playing, and how many seats are still open.
- **Bookings:** Lets people book seats for a showtime, saves that booking, and marks those seats as taken.
- **APIs for all this:** Special "doors" that the frontend uses to ask for info or change things (like "get me all movies please!")

### In the Frontend (the "face"):
- **Signup Page:** New users can fill a form to get an account.
- **Login Page:** Old users can enter their info to log in.
- **Homepage:** Shows a list of movies.
- **About Page:** Tells users about the site.
- **Some CSS:** Makes pages look pretty (colors/styles).

## What's left to build and how do you do it?
Imagine you're building a playground, and some slides/swings are missing. Here's what is missing so far, and how you'd *add* them if you were an engineer:

| What's Missing?            | What Is It?                                                      | How Could You Build It?                               |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Payment connection         | Let users pay online for tickets                                  | Learn about "payment gateways" like Stripe/PayPal; connect using their docs |
| Booking seat selection     | Let users *choose* exactly which seats they want                  | Make a seat map (like a grid), let users click to select, check with backend to reserve |
| Booking history and profile| Show users their old bookings and allow basic profile editing     | Add pages and endpoints for "see all my bookings," "edit account info"         |
| Admin panel                | Staff can add movies, update times, see all bookings (not just users) | Add an "admin" role, special admin-only pages, extra backend APIs      |
| Email notifications        | Email users when booking is confirmed                             | Use a library to send emails (like Nodemailer for Node.js)                      |
| More fancy design/features | Better info, trailers, movie filters, reviews, etc!               | Add new pages/components, work with designer friends, let users rate/review    |

## How to read the code & folder structure
Break it down like different themed rooms in a big, fun house:

### Backend (inside backend/server/)
- **models/** – the "blueprints" for Users, Bookings, Movies, Showtimes
- **controllers/** – the "brains" for each thing; what happens when you sign up, book a seat, etc
- **routes/** – the "roads" that say what URLs do what actions
- **middleware/** – special helpers (like security guards or teachers!)
- **config/** – settings, like the keys to the playground

### Frontend (inside frontend/src/)
- **pages/** – each web page (Home, Login, About, etc)
- **components/** – repeated blocks like navbar (the top menu)
- **assets/** – images, icons, and other decorations

## Step-by-Step: How to Add New Features
Suppose you want to add "see booking history":

1. **Backend**
   - Add an API route: `/api/bookings/mybookings`
   - Make a function ("controller") that finds all bookings for the user who is logged in.
   - Test using tools like Postman. Make sure it returns correct data.

2. **Frontend**
   - Create a page called `MyBookings.jsx` that shows a list of bookings.
   - On login or from navbar, link to this page.
   - Fetch bookings from the backend and show them nicely.

**This pattern—add backend logic, then frontend page—works for almost every feature!**

## Words and Concepts Explained Like You're Five

- **API:** Like a magic walkie-talkie for your site. Whenever you click "book" or "show movies," your browser whispers to the backend and asks, "Can you tell me the answer?"
- **Model:** Blueprint for something. If you build a LEGO airplane, the model tells you how many small pieces (fields) it has.
- **Controller:** The boss. When you say "Book a ticket!" the controller says, "okay, let me check if that seat is free, and mark it as booked if so."
- **Route:** The address you visit when you want to go to a page or take an action (like "/login", "/books", etc).
- **Component:** Little building blocks for websites—like LEGO windows and doors for your pages.

## Summary (Like a Big Checklist!)

- **What's already done:** You can sign up, log in, see movies, and book basic tickets.
- **What's left:** Fancy seat selection, payment, profile/history, admin panel, emails, better style.
- **How to keep building:** Always add a backend "API" and a frontend "page or component" for every new thing you want!
